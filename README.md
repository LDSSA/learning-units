If you are a student and have somehow found your way here, please note that
we are not quite done. Feel free to poke around but don't take anything
as written in stone just yet.

# learning-units

Right now we are working on developing an example learning unit. Until it is decided upon, the root of this repo
will be the example learning unit.

## Step 1

Install:
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
  - If you're on Windows or OS X and don't know what git is, [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is probably easiest.
  - All others: you probably know what to do.
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

## Step 2

Clone this repository and enter the directory on the command line.

## Step 3

Open a terminal and run

```
bash run-jupyter-notebook.sh
```

### Step 4

Click the link that is displayed to open the notebook.
