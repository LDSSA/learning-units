# learning-units

Right now we are working on developing an example learning unit. Until it is decided upon, the root of this repo
will be the example learning unit.

## Step 1

Install:
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
  - If you're on Windows or OS X and don't know what git is, [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is probably easiest.
  - All others: you probably know what to do.
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

## Step 2

Clone this repository and enter the directory on the command line.

## Step 3

Open a terminal and run

```
bash run-jupyter-notebook.sh
