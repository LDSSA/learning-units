# Classifiers

In this directory you will learn about some of the different classifiers, and their respective use cases.
You will also play doctor, and try to diagnose breast cancer based on the characterists of cells!

# Exercise
Using the classifiers your learned about, predict the target in our dataset, "Class". 0 stands for benign, 1 for malignant.
The features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
