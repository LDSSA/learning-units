# Linear Regression

In this directory you will be learning how to work with linear regression on a set of input
variables to be able to estimate the output/predicted values. In the example section we 
will be covering linear regression on a single variable and then you will have to
perform an exercise where you apply linear regression on multiple variables. As a bonus, we 
will explain what we can do to improve linear regression when the dynamic range of the 
different variables is very different and also when some variables are not very useful and thus
create more problems than help in the regression.
